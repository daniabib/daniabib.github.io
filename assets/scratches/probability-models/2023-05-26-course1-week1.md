# Probabilistic Graphical Models - Course 1, Week 1
## Declarative representations, or model-based methods 
The key property of a declarative representation is the separation of knowledge and reasoning

## Independence
Independence of twe events is different from been disjoint. Independence is a relation about information.
The intuitive notion of indenpence: two events are ind. if the occurance of one dosen't chang our beliefs about the other; does not affect the prob. of the other occurs. 

### Independece of random variables
A r.v. is indep. of another if the result of one don't give any relevant information about any of the events of the other distribution.

### Conditionig: Reduction 
- When we reduce a propability distribution by conditionig it to a particular result in some distribution.
- this operation outup isn't a probability dist. (it dosen't sum to 1).
- so we apply a *normalization*: sum then divide each entry by the sum.
