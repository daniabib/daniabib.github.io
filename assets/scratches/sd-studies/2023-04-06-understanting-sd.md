## FOUNDATIONS OF DIFFUSION MODELS
"Diffusion models are a family of probabilistic generative models that progressively destruct data by injecting noise,then learn to reverse this process for sample generation." (p. 5)

Three main formulation:
1. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)
1. Score-based Generative Models (SGMs)
1. Stochastic Differential Equations (Score SDEs)
